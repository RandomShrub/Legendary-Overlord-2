# Legendary Overlord 2.0

This project is for an Arduino Mega microcontroller to manage a variety of systems in a household. Beginning as a lamp switched by an old TV remote, my "RoomControl" project has been reformed, revived, and recreated many times by myself. Some versions in the past weren't even completed to a functional level. The best build to date was called "Mythic Overlord," a functional extension of the Legendary Overlord. Mythic attempted to make the code run lighter, but ultimately failed, since the simplicity of the base resulted in greater complexity of once simple functions. As of right now, this repository is *not* functional, as it is under development.

Documentation may appear here spontaneously. One day it will be organized, but it will begin as notes for myself to keep track of things.
